In the preceding code, we apply different weights to the search vectors built using the title and body
fields. The default weights are D, C, B, and A, and they refer to the numbers 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 1.0,
respectively. We apply a weight of 1.0 to the title search vector (A) and a weight of 0.4 to the body
vector (B). Title matches will prevail over body content matches. We filter the results to display only
the ones with a rank higher than 0.3.
Searching with trigram similarity
Another search approach is trigram similarity. A trigram is a group of three consecutive characters.
You can measure the similarity of two strings by counting the number of trigrams that they share.
This approach turns out to be very effective for measuring the similarity of words in many languages.
To use trigrams in PostgreSQL, you will need to install the pg_trgm extension first. Execute the following command in the shell prompt to connect to your database:
